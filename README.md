# Predictive-Maintenance
The aim of the project work is to construct a structured dataset based on official data provided by the Italian
Medicines Agency (AIFA), including information about regulatory and clinical aspects of medicines that are currently
authorized in Italy. It has been first downloaded the dataset but after a few days AIFA website updated the dataset,
so it could be seen the differences between the two datasets.
